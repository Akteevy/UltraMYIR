## Vitis accelerated flow tutorial
This is a series of tutorials to show how to create a Vitis project using the Vitis accelerated flow and the MYD-CZU3EG board.
It is divided in three steps:
- Creation of the hardware platform with Vivado
- Creation of the linux kernel image and boot software
- Creation of the Vitis platform and application

These tutorials are developed on a Linux virtual machine with Ubuntu 20.04.1 and Xilinx tools 2021.2
