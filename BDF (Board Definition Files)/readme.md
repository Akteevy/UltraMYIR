Ultramyir BDF
=============

These are the board definition files (BDF) for the MYIR MYD-CZU3EG board. 

## Installation

Copy the ultramyir folder and its contents in:

\<Vivado\>\data\boards\board_files\

Where \<Vivado\> is the installation folder, typically: C:\Xilinx\Vivado\2018.3\ (for 2018.3 release)

Board files should be compatible with all Vivado releases as long as they support the part XCZU3EG-SFVC784-1-E

Note it is necessary to close and open Vivado again to read the BDF after copying them
